* Teal Swan Frequency Painting Downloader
  This program downloads all paintings from Teal Swan's website.

  This used to be 100 or so lines of POSIX shell, but I rewrote it in Clojure. This artist has some pretty cool paintings, but there's over 200 of them, and I didn't want to try clicking to download each one.

https://tealswan.com/paintings/

** How to use
   Just download the latest =.jar= file from the [[https://github.com/wildwestrom/tsdl/releases][releases page]], then run it.

   It will ask you for your username and password for [[https://tealswan.com/][tealswan.com]].\\
   You will need a premium account in order to download images in high quality.

   In the future I may create a low-res download option that doesn't require logging in.

** Building from source
   Clone the source code, then with Clojure CLI tools build an uberjar.

   #+begin_src shell
     git clone https://github.com/wildwestrom/tsdl.git
     cd tsdl/
     clojure -X:uberjar
   #+end_src
