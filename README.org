* Teal Swan Frequency Painting Downloader
This program downloads all paintings from Teal Swan's website.

This used to be 100 or so lines of POSIX shell, but I rewrote it in Clojure. This artist has some pretty cool paintings, but there's over 200 of them, and I didn't want to try clicking to download each one.

* TODO Figure out how to edit metadata on images.
  I want to add the little description blurb to the description field of each image.

* TODO Add a low-res download option
  Even without a premium account, you can still get the low-res versions of the images.

* TODO Add a GUI for easy login.
  I'm still deciding on what I should use for a GUI.\\
  Currently looking at:
  - cljfx
  - seesaw
  - electron
  - neutralino
  - tauri

* License
  ~tsdl~ is free software, but in order to access Teal Swan's paintings, you need a premium membership.
